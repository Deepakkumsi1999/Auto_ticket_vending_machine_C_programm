I developed this program for Automatic train ticket vending machine using c program ,At Railway Stations, ATVMs (Automatic Ticket Vending Machines) are used for booking tickets.
The goal of this project is to create an interface for ATVM machines that allow travelers to purchase tickets at train stations.

This C program is a basic implementation of a simple Auto Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) application, version 1.0. It allows users to perform three main actions: purchasing a train ticket, displaying their ticket purchase history, and exiting the program.

The program begins with a welcome message, presenting the user with a menu of options. The available choices are:

Purchase Ticket: This option allows the user to buy a train ticket.
Display Ticket History: Users can view their ticket purchase history.
Exit: This choice terminates the program.
The user is prompted to enter their choice, and based on their input, the program executes the corresponding action using a switch statement. 
If the user chooses option 1, the purchaseTicket() function is called. 
If they select option 2, the displayTicketHistory() function is called . 
Option 3 allows the user to exit the program with a farewell message. If the user inputs an invalid choice, 
the program prompts them to try again.

The program continues to display the menu and accept user input until the user decides to exit by choosing option 3.
